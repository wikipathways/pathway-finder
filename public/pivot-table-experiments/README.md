# Pivot table for pathway finder?

The code in this folder is non-functional, but it contains a few experimental efforts to look at using pivot tables to make data from Pathway Finder more accessible to users.

* [Orb](https://github.com/nnajm/orb): great start but no longer maintained. Many forks, some of which may be maintained, e.g. [orb-latest](https://github.com/davidpelayo/orb-latest).
* [React Virtualized Pivot](https://github.com/turnerniles/react-virtualized-pivot): a promising effort that appears to be maintained. I haven't tried it much. This is related: [Quick Pivot](https://github.com/pat310/quick-pivot). [A comment on relationship](https://github.com/nnajm/orb/issues/87#issuecomment-311539784).
